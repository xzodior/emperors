    <h1 id="title">Flavius Valerius Constantinus</h1>
        <p>Constantine I, aka Constantine the Great, was Roman emperor from 306 to 337 CE. 
            Realizing that the Roman Empire was too large for one man to adequately rule, Emperor Diocletian 
            (284-305 CE) split the empire into two, creating a tetrachy or rule of four. While he ruled the east 
            from Nicomedia as an "augustus" with Galerius as his "caesar," Maximian and Constantius the Pale ruled 
            the west. It was the son of Constantius, Constantine, who would one day rise to defeat all challengers 
            to the throne and reunite the split empire, moving the capital away from Old Rome and build a new eastern 
            capital, a capital that one day would bear his name, Constantinople.</p>

        <p>During his years of warfare in the west he had always demonstrated religious tolerance with both pagans and 
            Christians (he claimed to be a Christian since 312 CE). His mother Helena was a devout Christian, and after 
            Constantine became emperor, he sent her on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land where she had built the Church of 
            the Nativity at Bethlehem. Although he had been a worshipper of the sun-god in his youth and while some claim 
            he did not become baptized until his deathbed, he still gave every indication that he was a devoted Christian. 
            He is even credited by many historians with making Christianity the official religion of the empire (although 
            others credit Emperor Theodosius), despite the fact that pagan symbols of Sol Invictus and Mars appeared on his
             coins. While he tolerated certain pagan religious practices, religious freedom had its limits, pagan sacrifices
              were forbidden, temple treasures seized, gladiatorial contests ended (Christians disliked them), crucifixions
               were abolished, and laws were enacted against sexual immorality and ritual prostitution.</p>
