    <h1 id="title">Imperator Caesar Augustus</h1>
        <p>Augustus Caesar (27 BCE - 14 CE) was the name of the first and, by most accounts, greatest Roman emperor. 
            Augustus was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus on 23 September 63 BCE. Octavian was adopted by his great-uncle
            Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, and then took the name Gaius Julius Caesar. In 27 BCE the Senate awarded him the
            honorific Augustus ("the illustrious one"), and he was then known as Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus.</p>
        <p>Owing to the many names the man went by in his life, it is common to call him Octavius when referring to 
            events between 63 and 44 BCE, Octavian when referring to events between 44 and 27 BCE, and Augustus regarding
             events from 27 BCE to his death in 14 CE. It should be noted, however, that Octavian himself, between the years
              44 and 27 BCE, never went by that name, choosing instead to align himself closely with his great uncle by 
              carrying the same name; a decision which prompted Mark Antony's famous accusation, as recorded by Cicero: 
              "You, boy, owe everything to your name".</p>
