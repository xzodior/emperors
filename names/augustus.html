    <h1 id="title">Imperator Caesar Augustus</h1>
        <p>Augustus Caesar (27 BCE - 14 CE) was the name of the first and, by most accounts, greatest Roman emperor. 
            Augustus was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus on 23 September 63 BCE. Octavian was adopted by his great-uncle
            Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, and then took the name Gaius Julius Caesar. In 27 BCE the Senate awarded him the
            honorific Augustus ("the illustrious one"), and he was then known as Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus.</p>
        <p>Owing to the many names the man went by in his life, it is common to call him Octavius when referring to 
            events between 63 and 44 BCE, Octavian when referring to events between 44 and 27 BCE, and Augustus regarding
             events from 27 BCE to his death in 14 CE. It should be noted, however, that Octavian himself, between the years
              44 and 27 BCE, never went by that name, choosing instead to align himself closely with his great uncle by 
              carrying the same name; a decision which prompted Mark Antony's famous accusation, as recorded by Cicero: 
              "You, boy, owe everything to your name".</p>

        <p>After Julius Caesar's assassination in March of 44 BCE, Octavian allied himself with Caesar's close friend and 
            relative, Mark Antony. Together with another supporter of Caesar, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Antony and Octavian 
            formed the Second Triumvirate in October of 43 BCE. Their first order of business seems to have been the systematic 
            killing of any political rivals and supporters of Caesar's assassins. Exactly which of the three was most responsible 
            for the killings is disputed by ancient and modern writers alike with some claiming Octavian innocent and others ascribing
             to him the most bloodshed. Having cleansed Rome of the 'bad blood' of their opposition, the Second Triumvirate then 
             turned their attention to Caesar's assassins. At the Battle of Phillipi in October 42 BCE, the forces of Brutus and 
             Cassius were defeated by those of the Second Triumvirate forcing both assassins to kill themselves.</p>
