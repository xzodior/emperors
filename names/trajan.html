    <h1 id="title">Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Augustus</h1>
        <p>Trajan, or Marcus Ulpius Traianus, was Roman emperor from 98 to 117 CE. Known as a benevolent ruler, 
            his reign was noted for public projects which benefitted the populace such as improving the dilapidated 
            road system, constructing aqueducts, building public baths and extending the port of Ostia. Trajan was 
            also a highly successful general and won three major conflicts against the Dacians and in the east, resulting 
            in the Roman Empire reaching its greatest size up to that date.</p>

        <p>When Nerva died in January 98 CE, Trajan did not immediately return to Rome. Instead, he inspected the Rhine and 
            Danube frontiers to not only safeguard against the Dacians but also to test the allegiance of many of the legions 
            still loyal to Domitian. Finally, in the summer of 99 CE, he made his entry into Rome on foot where he mingled with 
            both the citizenry and senators. Pliny the Younger (61-112 CE) - a lawyer, author, and governor of Bithynia - often 
            corresponded with Emperor Trajan on a variety of topics. After Nerva's death and Trajan's ascension, Pliny wrote one
            of his many letters to the new emperor, ”May you then, and would through your means, enjoy every prosperity worthy 
            of your reign: to which let me add my wishes, most excellent Emperor, upon a private as well as public account, that
            your health and spirits may be preserved firm and unbroken.”</p>
