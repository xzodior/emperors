    <h1 id="title">Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus</h1>
        <p>Marcus Aurelius reigned as Roman emperor from 161 to 180 CE and is best known as the last of the Five 
            Good Emperors of Rome (following Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius) and as the author of the 
            philosophical work Meditations. He has long been respected as embodying the Platonic concept of the 
            Philosopher King as articulated in Plato's Republic: a ruler who does not seek power for his own sake 
            but to help his people. He was introduced to philosophy at a young age and his Meditations, composed 
            while on campaign in his fifties, make clear that he held a deeply philosophical, specifically Stoic, 
            view throughout his life.</p>

    <p>In the modern-day, he is probably best known from the popular film Gladiator (2000 CE) as the father of Commodus 
        (r.177-192 CE) whose decision to pass over his son as successor serves as the point of departure for the film's plot.
        Contrary to his depiction in the film, Aurelius was not killed by Commodus and, in fact, Commodus would co-rule 
        with his father from 177-180 CE and succeeded him without opposition; though he would prove to be one of the worst 
        rulers Rome would have to endure and his reputation suffered further by comparison with his father.</p>
