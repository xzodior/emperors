    <h1 id="title">Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus</h1>
        <p>Hadrian (l. 78-138 CE) was emperor of Rome (r. 117-138 CE) and is recognized as the third of the Five Good 
            Emperors (Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius) who ruled justly. His reign marked 
            the height of the Roman Empire, usually given as c. 117 CE, and provided a firm foundation for his successor.</p>
        <p>Born Publius Aelius Hadrianus, in Italica (modern Spain), Hadrian is best known for his literary pursuits, his 
            substantial building projects throughout the Roman Empire, and, especially, Hadrian's Wall in northern Britain. 
            He is also remembered for his love affair with the Bithynian youth Antinous (l. c. 110-130 CE) whom he deified 
            after the young man's death, resulting in the popular cult of Antinous which, early on, rivaled Christianity.</p>

        <p>Hadrian was deeply interested in literature - especially Greek literature - and Egyptian mysticism and magic. 
            He was among the most highly cultured of the Roman emperors - even among the famous best five - wrote his own 
            poetry and other works and insisted on personally supervising as many of the building projects he had commissioned 
            as he possibly could. Under his reign, the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-136 CE) broke out in Judaea, which Hadrian 
            personally put down and, afterwards, erased the name of the region, renamed it Syria Palaestina, and exiled 
            the Jewish population from the area.</p>
